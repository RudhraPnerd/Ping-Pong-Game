### What is Circle Ping Pong

Circle Ping Pong is a fun, simple game where you control a paddle (though not yet implemented in this version, the basic mechanics are there!) to keep a ball within a central circular play area. If the ball goes outside the circle, it's game over! The goal is to keep the ball bouncing inside for as long as possible.

### How to Play

Save the files: Make sure you have main.py and configs.py saved in the same directory on your computer.

Install Pygame: If you don't already have it, you'll need the Pygame library. Open your terminal or command prompt and type:

`pip install pygame`


Run the game: Navigate to the directory where you saved your files in your terminal or command prompt and run the main game file:

`python main.py`


### Gameplay:

The game starts with a ball moving within a gray circle.

If the ball crosses the boundary of the light red circle, the ball will just roll out of the screen.

To play again, you just mannually close down the window fully and then run the project again. Sorry for those people that think it's inconvenient.

To close the game window, click the 'X' button at the top right corner as all you Windows users might know
